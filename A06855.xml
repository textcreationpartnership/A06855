            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE auncient Lawes of this Realme hauing always had a ſpeciall regard, vnto the continuall ſtudie &amp; care that Kings and Princes haue in great and waightie affaires of matters of Common weale, for the good of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes: whereby they are often times wearyed with the toyle of the ſame: and in reſpect thereof, the ſame lawes haue giuen vnto them diuers royall prerogatiues of moſt noble and princely pleaſures to recreate themſelues withal, to put away from them the remembrance of their labourſome toyle. Amongſt which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues, the royall prerogatiue of the libertie of a Forest is not the leaſt: For, a Foreſt both is and hath beene alwayes accompted a francheſe of ſuch noble and Princely pleaſure, that it is not incident vnto any ſubiect of this Ralme to haue the ſame, but onely vnto the Crowne and royall dignitie of a Prince. And therefore there haue beene alwayes certain particular lawes differing from the Common Lawes of this Realme, that were onely proper vnto a Foreſt, belonging to the ſame for the continuance of it.</p>
            <p>And it doth ſeeme that Foreſtes haue beene of long time, and that they are very auncient things, although, peraduenture, not in that nature that they are now vſed heere in this Realme of England. For it doth appeare, that there were Foreſtes, yea, euen in the verie tyme of king <hi>Dauid:</hi>
               <note place="margin">King Dauid in his 50. Pſalm. ver. 10.</note> For he ſaith in his 50. Pſalme theſe wordes, <hi>O Lord, I neede not to offer vnto thee burnt Sacrifices of beaſtes: for all the wilde beaſtes of the Foreſt are thine, and ſo are the Cattell vpon a thowſand Hilles:</hi> Then <hi>Ergo</hi> there were Foreſtes of wilde beaſtes in his time. And it doth alſo appeare by ſundry auncient Histories, as in <hi>Concordantia Hiſtoriarum</hi> &amp; others,<note place="margin">Concordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Hiſtoriar.</note> that Foreſtes haue beene alwayes in this Realme, from the firſt tyme that the ſame was inhabited.<note place="margin">Gurguntius.</note> And alſo you may read there that <hi>Gurguntius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Belyn</hi> being a king of this lande, did make certaine Foreſtes for his delight and pleaſure in Wilſhire: and ſo haue diuers other kings alſo ſince his tyme in other places meete for that purpoſe: VVhich Foreſtes the Kings and Princes of this Realme haue alwayes mayntained and preſerued, (with diuers Priuileges and Lawes appertaining to the ſame,) for places of pleaſure and delight for their recreation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:27422:3"/>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they are the moſt auncienteſt lawes that I can find concerning Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes, therfore I haue placed them firſt of all before any others, to thend that thoſe that ſhall read this booke, may both ſee &amp; know what lawes there were in the beginning, concerning Foreſtes, and how they haue altered &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from time to time: and to that end I haue here ſet downe all the Statuts concerning Foreſtes that haue beene made ſince the time of the making of the ſaid lawes, becauſe that it may thereby appeare the more plainly how any one of them hath abrogated another, or any part thereof: by reaſon whereof, that which is lawe and in force at this day may the more eaſier be decerned and knowen.</p>
            <p>It appeareth by the Lawes of <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane king in his Canon the <hi>30.</hi> that before his time, all wild beaſtes &amp; birdes were onely the kings: and that no other perſon might kill or hurt them.<note place="margin">Canutus Canon. 30.</note> For the king by his royall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, his right and priuilege was ſuch in England, that all ſuch things that none of his ſubiects could challenge any propertie in, they were then ſaid to be the Kings: as wilde beaſtes, byrds, &amp; ſuch like, in whoſe lands or woods ſoeuer they were found. Wherefore the ſame king made this law, <hi>Volo vt omnis liber homo pro libito ſuo habeat venerem ſiue viridem in planis ſuis ſuper terras ſuas ſine Chacea tamen, et deuitent omnes meam vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque eam habere voluero,</hi> which is: that from hencefoorth, I will (ſaith the king) that euery free man may take his own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ert &amp; Venerie or hunting that he can gett vpon his owne ground, or in his owne feelds, being out of my Chaſe.

            <p>For in the firſt booke of his Lawes made in the <hi>19.</hi> yeare of his raigne, Chap. <hi>16.</hi> he rehearſeth and declareth the Lawe of the Foreſt, and the very nature of that, and doth farther ſhewe there, how that the Lawes of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt do varie and differ from the Common Lawe of this Realme, as it doth appeare in the ſaid redd Booke in the Excheker in theſe wordes, <hi>Sane Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarum, lex, ratio pena quoque vel abſolutio delinquentium ſiue pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaria fuerit ſiue corporalis ſcorſum ab aliis regni ludicijs ſecernuntur &amp; folius regis arbitrio ſeu cuiuſlibet familiaris ad haec ſpecialiter depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati ſubijcitur, legibus quidem proprijs ſubſiſtit, quas non lure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni ſed voluntaria principum Inſtitutione ſubnixaſſe debent, adeo vt per legem eius factum fuerit non Iuſtum abſolute, ſed Iuſtum ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum legem Foreſtae dicatur, quia in Foreſtis penetralia regum ſunt &amp; corum maximae deliciae ad has quidem venandi cauſa Curis quando<expan>

For after the ſame was ſo afforeſted, their paſtures and profits of their lands was deuowred by the wilde beaſtes of the king without any recompence for the ſame to be made vnto them. And this lawe of afforeſting of the landes and inheritance of other men did then daily ſo increaſe, that the ſame was thought a very extreme heauie burthen, aſwel vnto noble men and gentlemen, as alſo vnto the poore comminaltie of this Realme to beare: for that they might not incloſe their land, nor improue the ſame to their beſt profite that was ſo afforeſted by the king. But they were forced to ſuffer their ſaid lands aforeſted to lye open and not incloſed. And if any of them did chaunce to offend againſt the Aſsiſes or Lawes of the Foreſt, the puniſhment was ſometimes verie great for a ſmall offence: and the
<pb facs="tcp:27422:4"/> forfeitures for the ſame, according to the will and pleaſure of the king, and not according to the quantitie of the treſpas, nor yet according to the courſe of the Common lawe of this Realme. And this law did continue during the life of king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. And after his deceaſe, the ſame conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued likewiſe during the raigne of king <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt. And then after his deſeaſe, likewiſe during the raigne of king <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Richard the firſt. King Iohn</note> And euery one of the ſaide kings did daily increaſe and make more newe Foreſtes and more in the lands of their ſubiectes, to the great hinderance and impoueriſhing of their ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>And this miſchiefe was not at all remedied vntill the making of the Charter of the liberties of the Foreſt,<note place="margin">Henry the third.</note> which was made by king <hi>Henry</hi> the thirde. And afterwardes the ſame Charter was confirmed and enlarged by king <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt his ſonne: which Charter was made for the pacifying of the Comminaltie of this Realme that then were much agreeued at this miſchiefe.<note place="margin">Edward the firſt.</note> And therefore the ſame Charter called <hi>Carta de Foreſta</hi> euen in the verie firſt Article of the ſame did prouide a remedie in that behalfe in theſe wordes, <hi>Omnes Foreſtae quas Henricus auus noſter aforeſtauit videantur per bonos &amp; legales homines et ſi boſcum aliquem alium quam ſuum dominicum afforeſtauerit ad damnum illius cuius boſcus ille fuerit ſtatim deaforeſtentur &amp;c.</hi> By which branch of the ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you do ſee, that all Foreſtes that king <hi>Henry</hi> the third had made of the lands of any of his ſubiects, which were not the kings owne demeane landes, are here appointed to be diſaforeſted againe.</p>
            <p>And againe, in the third Article of the ſaid Charter of the Forest, there is the verie like remedie and prouiſion, that all ſuch Foreſtes which king <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the firſt and alſo king <hi>Iohn</hi> had aforeſted and made of the landes or woodes of any of his ſubiectes, being not the demeaſne landes of the Crowne, that then all thoſe landes and woods ſhould be diſaforeſted againe: For theſe three kings, that is to ſaye, king <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the thirde had then newly aforeſted ſo much of the landes of their ſubiectes, that the greateſt part of this Realme was then become Foreſt.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the miſchiefes, inconueniences, and burthens that were then layde vpon the Comminaltie of this Realme, were verie great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, by the meanes of the Lawes of the Foreſt: therefore the ſaid Charter of the Liberties of the Foreſt, hath now moderated the extremeneſſe of thoſe Lawes in a more mylder order, as you may perceiue by the ſame.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:27422:5"/>
            <p>For he that doth attentiuely read and examine the whole Charter of the Foreſt, and euery Article therein, may thereby partly perceiue how harde and ſharpe the lawes of the Foreſt were in tymes past before the graunting of the ſame Charter: And alſo what inconueniences the inhabitants in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes did then indure &amp; ſuffer, by reaſon of the Foreſt lawes: all which are now prouided for, and in a meaſurable maner remedied, as you may perceiue by the examination of euery Article of the ſaid Charter. And whereas the ſame Charter did allow or ſuffer any thing that hath ſince that time beene thought to be ouer harde or ſharpe: the ſame hath ſince againe beene mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as you may here perceiue by thoſe Statutes that haue beene made ſince that time: So gracious and mercifull haue the Noble Princes of this Realme beene towardes their louing Subiectes: So that now at this day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the lawes of the Foreſt are of themſelues verie mylde, gentle &amp; mercifull lawes towards the Subiects of this Realme, ouer that they haue beene in times past. Yet notwithſtanding, we do at this preſent liue vnder the gouernement of ſo gratious and mercifull a Queene, that her clemencie in the execution of thoſe lawes, is much more greater than the fauour &amp; cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the Lawes themſelues: VVhoſe long life, proſperous raigne, and moſt happie dayes, GOD of his mercifull goodnes grant long to continue, to the great comfort of all good Chriſtian Subiectes.

                  <p n="1">1 Firſt, that euery Indictment againſt any offendor, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences done in the foreſt, muſt be certaine concerning the thing it ſelfe, for which the offendor is Indited, as to ſhew that it was for killing of a Hart, and alſo to ſhew where he was proclaimed a Hart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, that it muſt be certaine, concerning the place where the offence was done, for that the killing of the Hart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the foreſt, or without the foreſt, doth make the ſame killing an offence, or no offence, &amp; therefore it muſt be ſhewed in the Indicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment certaine,<note place="margin">Et vide le caſe 12 H. 8. fo 10. que proue qui ſi ceruus eſt extra foreſtam vagrans eſt loyal a cheſcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubiect a occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; apren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ceo.</note> in what place of the foreſt the ſame Hart was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for otherwiſe it doth not appeare that it was any offence by the Lawes of the foreſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, it is to be noted that a Hart proclaimed, (which is called in <hi>Canutus</hi> Lawes, <hi>fera Regalis</hi> a Roiall beaſt, being a beaſt of the moſt eſtimation of any wilde beaſt in the foreſt,) yet if he be wandering out of the foreſt, it is lawfull for any of the kings Subiects to kill him, without any offence in the foreſt Lawes.</p>

By which caſe you may note, that no man can haue any mannors or lands within the Foreſt, but they muſt be ſubiect to the Lawes and bondage of the Foreſt, that is, that the King (in reſpect of the wilde beaſtes that are there to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his princely pleaſure and delight, which cannot be there kept and preſerued without Couert and ſecrete places for them to reſt and abyde in:) hath ſuch a prerogatiue ouer the woods of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man within the ſame Foreſt, that no man may fell or deſtroye his owne woods without licence of the Iuſtice of the Foreſt:<note place="margin">Conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; aſſiſa foreſta, fo. 29.</note> and ſo it doth alſo appeare by the ſtatute called <hi>Conſuetudines &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſa Foreſta, cap.</hi> 6. in theſe wordes, <hi>Liberatio autem</hi> houſebote &amp; haybote <hi>fiat pro vt boſcus pati poteſt, in ſtatu quo eſt &amp; non ad exigentiam petentis: nec poteſt aliquid dare nec vendere, de boſco ſine warranto domini Regis,</hi> which in Engliſh is thus: But deliuerie of houſebote and haybote ſhalbe made as the wood may ſuffer the ſame, to remaine in the ſtate in which it is, and not at the requeſt of the demaundant, neither may he giue or ſell any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing of the wood without the kings warrant, by which lawe it doth appeare that a man may not take houſebote nor haybote, but by deliuerie of the Foreſter, or warrant of the King.</p>
                  <p>And by the Statute of <hi>Anno primo</hi> of Edward the third, ca. 2 It is plaine, that no wan in the Foreſt may take or cut down any

               <head>The Courtes of the Foreſt.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, it is to be vnderſtood, that there be thrée principall and chiefe Courtes vſually kept for matters of the Foreſt, that is to ſaie: the Court of Attachementes: the Courte of Swanimote: and the highe Courte of the Lord Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt, commonly called the Iuſtice ſeate. And theſe thrée ſeuerall Courtes are of thrée ſeueral natures as at large hereafter it ſhal appeare: wherefore to the entent that the ſaide Courtes may the better be known euerie one in his own proper nature, I haue here ſet them downe, &amp; placed each one of them in his owne place and degrée as they are, together with their ſeuerall authorities and procedings, as you may ſée hereafter. And becauſe the ſaid court of Attachmentes is the meaneſt and loweſt Court of them all; For that, that in the ſaid Court of Attachments the officers there do nothing but receiue the Attachments of the Foreſters, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll them in the rolles of the verderors, to haue them in a readines againſt the time of the kéeping of the Court of Swanimote. And for that the ſaide Courte of Attachmentes cannot determine any offence or treſpaſſes of the Foreſt,<note place="margin">The Court of Attachmentes firſt.</note> If the value of the ſame treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe be aboue the value of iiii. pence: but that the ſame offence &amp; treſpaſſe, if the vaue be more then foure pence muſt be by the ſaide Verderors inrolled in their roll, &amp; ſo to be ſent from thence to the Swanimote to haue an orderly tryall of the ſame there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lawes of the Foreſt: Therefore I haue placed the ſame Court firſt of all, becauſe that the greateſt part of all the preſentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do firſt begin there: &amp; alſo becauſe that when offences and treſpaſſes of the Foreſt are preſented by the Foreſters in the ſaide Courte of Attachmentes before the verderors of the Foreſt, and that they haue entred them in the rolles and recordes of the Foreſt, then the ſame Court cannot there procede any further therein, neither is that proceding by them as yet any conuiction againſt the offender in thoſe offences: but that he that is ſuch a treſpaſſer may yet trauerſe the ſame preſentment that is againſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:27422:50"/> him, vntill that the ſame haue paſſed the Swanimote Court of the Foreſt: ſo that ſuch treſpaſſes as are preſented at the Court of Attachmentes, muſt of neceſſitie procede from thence to the Court of Swanimote before that the offendors and treſpaſſers may be puniſhed or ſtand conuicted as guilty in law of theire of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.<note place="margin">The Court of Swanimote next vnto it.</note> Therefore I haue placed the Court of Swanimote next vnto the ſaide Courte of Attachmentes, as a Court that is higher then the Court of Attachmentes, and yet more lower or inferior then the high Court of the ſeate of the Lord Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt. For when the preſentmentes of the Courts of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachmentes, as afore ſaide, and alſo all other preſentmentes of the Swanimote Courte, haue had theire procedings in the ſame Courte, according to the aſſiſes &amp; ordinances of the foreſt; &amp; that all the treſpaſſes of the foreſt are there <hi>preſentat' per Foreſtarios et duodecem Iuratores et conuict' per viridarios,</hi> as they muſt be of neceſſitie by the law: yet cannot the ſame Court of Swani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote then determine the ſame treſpaſſes or aſſeſſe any fine for any ſuch offence, or giue iudgement thereof (any other, then that the ſaide offendors are conuicted thereof, as is aforeſaid.) But the ſame preſentmentes, Indictmentes, and conuictions, muſt be deliuered to the Lord chiefe Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt at the Iuſtice ſeate the firſt day of the ſame ſeate, when they are called for, according to the ordinance of the Foreſt made in <hi>Anno Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsimo quarto Edwardi primi orticulo</hi> 1.

And becauſe that all the procedings of the two other Courtes are as

So that all attachmentes that this Court hath here by this Statuit any authoritie to deale with all, the ſame muſt concerne the hurte or iniurie that is done,<note place="margin">Of what thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Court of Attache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath authoritie to deale in.</note> or that is to be done to the Vert or Veniſon of the Foreſt, or elſe this Court is not to medle with the ſame, for their authoritie is but <hi>tam de viridi quam de venatione:</hi> So that you may ſée by this Statuit that euerie fortie daies through out the whole yeare it is appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Foreſters &amp; Verderors ſhall aſſemble themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſée the attachmentes of the Foreſt, as well of Vert as of Veniſon: wherein is ſhewed how often this Court ſhalbe kept and holden: The office of a Verderor at the ſame Court: and for what things the attachmentes there ought to be made. Nowe the wordes of the Statuit there are further as followeth: <hi>per pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentationem ipſorum Foreſtariorum, et coram ipſis attachiatis:</hi> In theſe wordes here is ſet downe the office of the Foreſters or kéepers, and wherfore they ought to come to this Court of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which is to preſent offendors, &amp; offences, or treſpaſſes there, &amp; to bring in the attachments there that they haue made of offendors, which they haue attached for doing of ſuch treſpaſſes in the Foreſt. For it appeareth by this Statute, that the office of the Verderors is to view the attachements there, and to receiue them, <hi>per preſentationem ipſorum foreſtariorum.</hi> And the office of the foreſters or kéepers at this Court is to preſent the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Foreſt before the Verderors, ſo that the difference betwéene the office of a Verderor, and the office of a Foreſter at this Court of attachmentes is this: that a Verderors office is, <hi>ad videndum attachiamenta de Foreſta:</hi> and a Foreſters office is <hi>ad preſentandum attachiamenta de Foreſta:</hi> and theſe wordes, <hi>et coram ipſis attachiatis,</hi> muſt be vnderſtood in this manner, as if the wordes had bene: <hi>Et coram ipſis viridarijs attachiatis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatis:</hi> that is to ſaie, preſented before the Verderors as thinges attached, or perſons that are attached for ſome treſpaſſes done in the Foreſt in Verte or Veniſon. And it doth ſéeme that before the making of this graunt of the liberties of the Foreſt, the Court
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27422:52"/> of Swanimote, and alſo the ſaid Court of attachmentes then called the Woodmote Court, were holden verie often, and yet not at any certaine time neither, but at the will and pleaſure of the chiefe officers of the Foreſt, which was a great trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the inhabitantes in Foreſtes. For the avoiding of which miſchiefs, this branch of this Statuit or graunt was made. Firſt to ſet down how often in euery yere the Swanimote ſhalbe kept. Secondly at what daies &amp; times in the yere the ſame ſhalbe kept. And thirdly that the courte of attachmentes ſhalbe kept euerie fortie daies throughout the whole yeare. And becauſe that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; treſpaſſes in Foreſts did daily increaſe and grow to be more &amp; more: and for that the ſaide Court of Swanimote is by this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute reſtrained to be kept any oftener then thrice in the yere: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſtatute hath ſpecially prouided that the Court of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ſhalbe holden and kept euerie fortie daies throughout the whole yeare: and that is a verie preciſe limitted authoritie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntid by this Charter for the kéeping and holding of the ſame Court of attachmentes:<note place="margin">He that hath an aucthoritie to do a thing, muſt follow his aucthoritie in doing of the ſame.</note> ſo that the ſame may not be kept or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in any other manner then by this lymitted authoritie is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. And it is held for good law at this daie, that if the court of attachments for the Foreſts be holden or kept in any other order then euerie xl. daies, that is to ſaie, in longer or ſhorter time then euery xl. daies, that then the kéeping of the ſame Court is void and without authoritie ſo to do: for that the ſame is not kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the limmited time appoynted by this Statuit. And yet I doe not think that all the procedings in the ſame Court ſo hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den are therefore voide in Lawe by that not holding of the Court according to the time apoynted: for if ſuch a Court of attachments be holden ſooner than euery fourtie dayes, which is contrarie to the limitted time appointed by the Statute, and at that Court ſo holden, there be diuers preſentments and attachements preſented againſt offenders in the Foreſt, &amp; afterwards thoſe preſentments do proceede to the Swanimote: and at the Swanimote Court the ſame treſpaſſor or offendor doth there take exceptions to the ſame preſentment preſented againſt him, for that the ſame was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27422:53"/> preſented at a Court of attachements that was not holden as the ſame ought to be by the limitted aucthoritie giuen by the ſaid ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: yet that Exception ſhall not auoide the ſame attachment or preſentment, for as much as the Court of attachmentes did not procede in the ſame Iudicially, but only to receiue the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment or attachment, to Enroll the ſame in their roll, and to deliuer it to the next Court of Swanimote: and ſuch a receiuing of a preſentment, or attachment at ſuch a Court ſo holden, cannot by any reaſon make the ſame voide, for as much as the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment or attachment had bene ſtill good in Law if the ſame had not at all bene preſented vntill the next Court of Swanimote and then preſented there, and not before. But if a Court of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes be holden contrarie to this Statuit: and a foreſter hauing attached an offendor in the Foreſt, to appeare at ſuch a Court of attachment before the Verderors, by an Oxe, or a Horſe, and the man ſo attached doth not there appeare at that Court,<note place="margin">Vide Maiſter Hesket, in his reading of the Foreſt. fo. 13.</note> wherfore the ſame court of attachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes doth giue iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that his beaſt is forfeted by his default, in not a pearing: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame beaſt ſhal be ſold &amp; the price therof to be leuied to the vſe of the king, This proceding now in this caſe is void in law: for in this caſe the ſaide Court of attachmentes doth procede herein Iudicially: but it is otherwiſe in the caſe before. Note the difference. And yet for all this, it is to be noted, that ſome times this court of attachmentes may be kept a daie or two more then fortie daies after the Court of attachmentes that was kept laſt before it, &amp; yet the ſame Court is not kept any otherwiſe then according to the meaning of the ſame Statuit: but that is but in certaine caſes of neceſſitie, which cannot otherwiſe be avoided: as if the iuſt fortieth daie next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the former Court daie, do fall to be vpon a Sundaie, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtmas daie: then the ſame Court day that ſo doth fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sunday or vpon Chriſtmas daie, may be deferred a daie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but that is becauſe of the neceſſitie that cannot be avoyded in that caſe: for it is to be thought, that it was not the meaning of this Charter of the Foreſt at the firſt, that this Court of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ſhould be kept vpon any ſuch daie as Sundaie or Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27422:53"/> daye which are prouided for the ſeruice of God only: for ſuch dayes are not accounted any dayes in Lawe to hold any Courtes in: and ſo neceſſitie here hath no Law in this caſe. And this Court of attachements doth differ from all other Courtes, in that the ſame is to be kept euery fourtie daies throughout the whole yere by the Verderors &amp;c. and therefore this Court is called of ſome men, the Verderors Courtes,<note place="margin">The Verderors Courte.</note> becauſe that the Verderors do kepe the ſame Courte: and yet at this Court of attachements, all the Foreſters of the Foreſt ought to appeare there alſo, by this Charter.<note place="margin">Maſter Hesket fo. 44.</note> And as Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> affirmeth in his learned reading of the Lawes of the Foreſt, fo. 44. all other officers and miniſters of the Foreſt ought to appeare at this Court of attachmentes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the letter of this Satute doth not ſpecifie ſo far by ſpeciall wordes: for the Statute doth ſpeake but of Foreſters and not of any other officers.

And if the chief Warden wil not ſo do, he ſhal haue a writ out of the Chauncery, which hath ben in old time ordained for ſuch perſons endicted to be at mainpriſe til the Eyre. And if ſuch a chief Warden after that he hath receiued the writ, doe not incontently deliuer ſuch perſons endicted to mainpriſe without taking any thing: then the plaintife ſhall haue a writ out of the Chauncery to the Shirif to attache the ſaid Warden to be before the king, at a certaine daie, to anſwer wherefore he hath not repleuied him that is ſo taken: and the Shirife, the Verderors being called to him, ſhall deliuer him that is ſo taken, by good mainpriſe in the preſence of the Verderors, and ſhall deliuer the names of the mainpernors to the ſame Verderors to aunſwere in the Eyre of the Iuſtices.

And therefore firſt of all it is to be noted, that in all caſes where any offender is to be attached by his goods and cattals, which is the firſt manner of attachements, or els to be attached by his bodie, by Pledges and mainpriſe which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner of attachement: The moſt méeteſt Officers to take bonde of ſuch offenders in the caſes aforeſaide, in the which they are by the Law to be bayled, are the Verderors, and that for two cauſes. The firſt is, that for as much as the ſaide Verderors are Iudges of Record, and haue the keeping of the rolles for matters of the Foreſt vntil the comming of the Lord Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt: therefore if the Foreſters do take any offender with the maner offending in Vert in the Foreſt, they are to attache him by the body, and to bring him before the Verderors: and then they may take a Recognizance of the offender and his Pledges to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the ſame offence in the Eyre of the Iuſtice of the Foreſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Iudges of Recorde, and therefore they may take a Recognizance in this caſe, and ſo may not the Foreſters do, for they are no Iudges of Recorde, but accuſers of offenders, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters of offences done by others in the Foreſt before the ſaide Verderors. The ſecond cauſe is for that, that the ſaide Verde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are men, that of neceſſitie muſt be learned and well practiſed in the knowledge of the Lawes of the Foreſt, and ſuch offenders muſt be bayled and Mainpriſed according to the qualitie &amp; degree of their offence, in ſome caſes by two Pledges: and in other ſome caſes by foure, ſixe, or eight Pledges: And in ſome other caſes, the offender is not to be bayled at all by the ſaid Verderors or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſters, as it hath beene already ſhewed before: nor yet by any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:27422:60"/> other perſon, but onely by the Lorde chiefe Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt, or by the chiefe Warden of the Foreſt. And then if the Foreſters or other Officers of the Foreſt that are ignorant of the Lawes of the Foreſt, ſhould take vpon them to bayle ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, no doubt but great inconueniences would enſewe thereby, aſwell vnto the King as alſo to the offenders themſelues: And therefore ſuch offenders are moſt meeteſt to be bayled by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Verderors, to the ende that the ſaide Verderors may bayle them according to the verie Lawes of the Foreſt. And for that cauſe the Lawe hath prouided and appointed a Stewarde that muſt be learned in thoſe Lawes to ioyne with them and to direct them in their proceeding, according to the ſame Law. And when ſuch offenders are Bayled before the ſaid Verderors, then the ſame Verderors are to keepe the ſame Recongnizance for the Kings vſe, vntill the comming of the Lord Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt, and alſo to cauſe the Foreſter to preſent the ſame offence in the ſame nature as it was done: and then ſuch preſentments to be entred in the Rolles of the Verderors accordingly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the Foreſters when they haue arreſted ſuch an offender might Bayle ſuch offenders themſelues at their owne wil &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures without the Verderors, there might be great parcialitie vſed therein: and many grieuous treſpaſſes concealed from the King, and neuer any preſentment made thereof before the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derors at the Court of Attachements, or at the Swanimoce Court.<note place="margin">Obligations taken to the Queenes vſe ſhalbe of the ſame nature as a Statute or Recognizanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It appeareth by this writ, that the authoritie of the Iuſtice of the Foreſt, doth differ from the authoritie of other Iuſtices in Eyer, for the Iuſtices of the Foreſt may make their deputie or Lieutenant to execute their office and place,<note place="margin">The Iuſtice of the Foreſt may make a deputy by the Statute of 32.

                  <p>And if the King which hath a Foreſt with all the incidentes vnto the ſame: &amp; he doth graunt the ſame vnto any other perſon: the grauntée ſhall not haue the Iuſticeſhip of the Foreſt by the ſame graunt: nor he ſhall not haue a Court of Swanimote in the proper nature of the ſame: for if ſuch a grauntée do kéepe a Court of Swanimote for his Foreſt: he cannot do any thing in the ſame but take preſentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes againſt offenders, as they do commonly vſe to do in the Court of Attachementes: &amp; the reaſon is, becauſe that the grauntée by ſuch a graunt, cannot haue Verderors nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardors, for they are choſen by the Kings writ: and there can be no procedings againſt offenders in Foreſts in the Court of Swanimote,<note place="margin">Treherne in his reading of the Lawes of the Foreſt fo. 7 Maſter Hesket in his reading of the Lawes of the Foreſt fo. 7.</note> without the Verderors and Regardors: And again it ſhalbe in vaine to haue a Court of Swanimote and ſuch officers in a Foreſt as is aforeſaide: if he may not by the Lawe haue a Iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſame Foreſt, that may cauſe Iuſtice to be executed of ſuch preſentments againſt ſuch offenders: but yet ſuch a grauntée as is aforeſaide, by the ſame graunt may haue Foreſters, Agiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Woodwardes, for the ſafe kéeping of his Vert and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon: as it doth appeare by Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> in his learned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Lawes of the Foreſt,<note place="margin">A Foreſt in the handes of the King: but a Chaſe in the handes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man.</note> fo. 7.</p>

                  <p>IT ſéemeth by Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> in his reading of the Lawes of the Foreſt: that vpon any Bill, preſentment or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for treſpaſſes done in the Foreſt, the defendant may appeare by an Attorney, or in proper perſon at his election to aunſwer the ſame treſpaſſe. But I do thinke that he doth meane by that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by an Attorney, to be at the Court of Attachementes, or at the Swanimote Courte, and not at the Iuſtice Seate before the Lorde chiefe Iuſtice in Eyre. For as I do take it, euery offender that is bounde to appeare there to aunſwer any treſpaſſe of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27422:88"/> Foreſt, he muſt appeare in proper perſon, and not by any Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: For although the ſame be but a treſpaſſe, yet in this treſpaſſe the King is a partie:<note place="margin">20.

E. 3. fo. that in treſpaſſe where the King is a partie: the defendand muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in proper perſon, and not by Attorney: and ſo a difference is there taken. And alſo all offenders that are bounde to appeare at the Iuſtice Seate, which haue been preſented at the Swanimote Courte before as they ought to be, they do ſtand conuicted in Lawe: ſo that they are then paſt aunſwering of their offence in that place.

And ſo generally, when any thing is by wrong incroched vpon the King or his tenauntes, the ſame is Purpreſture: and all ſuch Plees ſaith <hi>Glanuil</hi> doe belong to the Kings Crowne. The payne thereof is, that the offender ſhalbe gréeuouſly amerced, and the Purpreſture ſhalbe deſtroyed or elſe arented at the will and pleaſure of the King.

                  <p>But if the ſame Medow or paſture dolye within the Foreſt of the King, and yet out of the great couertes of the Foreſt, and the owner of the ſame doth plowe it and conuert the ſame Meddow or paſture into tillage:<note place="margin">A Waſt of the Foreſt.</note> Now this is not aſſartes or land aſſarted: but this is lande waſted, and ſhall be called a waſt of the Foreſt.

And if, afterdwardes the ſame owner of the ground hauing ſo waſted the ſame as is aforeſaide, do digg and plucke vp the rootes of the ſame Wood &amp; Trees out of the ground, and ſo make the ſame Couerte a plaine: then that is aſſartes, and ſhalbe called land aſſarted.

                  <p>Some men doe holde an opinion that the difference betwéene Purpreſture and aſſartes is, that Purpreſture is made vpon the Kings ground onely: and aſſartes vpon the lande of another man.

And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that aſſartes and purpreſtures may be made and done in the landes and woods of other men alſo: and therefore the ſame branch hath there ſet down a maner of proceding and puniſhment differing from the proceding &amp; puniſhing of thoſe that haue made aſſartes and purpreſture in the demeſne woodes and landes of the King. Then <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not the land of the king that doth make the difference betwéene aſſartes and purpreſtures, ſeing that both aſſartes and purpreſture are aſwell in the landes of other men, as in the landes of the King: and ſo to conclude in both.</p>
                  <p>But ſurely the trewe difference betwéene purpreſture and

                     </gap>e. And therefore the Lawes of the Foreſt hath ſet downe the foreſaide tenne points, as things that are moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue to the Kings wilde beaſts of the Foreſt: and for that cauſe they are prohibited by the lawe to be done or vſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt of them is, That no maner of perſon ſhall hunt in the Purlieus in the night, that is to ſaye, after that the Sunne is ſett vntill the ryſing of the ſame: for by the Lawe it is accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many caſes for a day, from the ryſing of the Sunne vntill the going downe of the ſame: And likewiſe for a night, from the time of the ſetting of the Sunne vntill the ryſing of the ſame: and ſuch a day is called <hi>Dies Solarius,</hi> that is, a day that is accompted by the Sunne. And the reaſon why it is not ſufferable for any perſon either Purlieu man or other, to hunt in the Purlieus in the night is, becauſe that the Kings wilde beaſtes may not bee troubled or diſquieted of their quiet feeding and reſt in the Foreſt: for it is not poſſible for any man to hunt in the purlieus in the night, but that the ſame will be <hi>Ad terrorem ferarum quae ſunt infra Foreſtam,</hi> for although that perhaps their dogges do not follow the wilde beaſtes out of the purlieus into the Foreſt in their chaſe after them, yet the noyſe of their running together, &amp; the gazening of thoſe Deare that are ſcared out of the purlieus, will diſturbe the quiet of the wilde beaſtes within the Foreſt. For the verie nature of the wilde beaſtes of the Foreſt is to ſeeke their foode in the night time when euery bodie is quiet and at reſt: for then they do not ſee any bodie ſturre vp and downe. Nor they are not troubled or feared with any noyſe. And all the day time they reſort to the Couerts being terrifyed with noyſe and the ſturring of men, ſo that they cannot feede quietly,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, it is not lawfull for any man to hunt in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieus on the Sonday: for that day is appointed for the ſeruice of Almightie God onely, and by his lawes that daye is to be kept holy, and not to be prophaned. For on that day all profitable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines is forbidden to be vſed, although that the ſame tend to the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:27422:98"/> profit and good of the common Weale: then <hi>Ergo</hi> much more all vaine buſines and ydle paſtimes, as hunting and ſuch like. And for that cauſe, the Lawes of this Realm do not accompt the Sonday to be any day in any Court at Weſtminſter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, No man may hunt in the Purlieus in the fence-moneth, or as it is called in the defence moneth, which moneth is alwayes fifteene dayes before Midſommer, and fifteene dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Midſommer, which Moneth is the time of fawning: for then the Fawnes are verie young and not able to runne or to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhift. Or els the Does are then great bellyed, ſo that they are not able to runne. And if a Purlieu hunter ſhould then chaſe in the Purlieus, and his Greyhound ſhould followe the Deare into the Foreſt, no doubt but that the ſame Greyhound would either deſtroy the Does being great with young, or the Fawnes being then very young. And neither of them both able to runne: or elſe the courſing amongſt them then would be <hi>ad magnum terrorem ferarum,</hi> and for that cauſe the ſame is forbidden for that Moneth by the Lawes of the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, It is not lawfull for any Purlieu hunter to hunt in his owne Purlieu euerie day, nor any oftener than three daies in one weeke, whereof the Sunday muſt not be any. And the reaſon is, becauſe that the wilde beaſtes in the Foreſt may not be diſquieted or put from their foode and wonted layer where they do vſe to lye at reſt with the noyſe and feare of their often hunting in the Purlieus. For the foreſt Lawes do prohibite things that are <hi>ad terrorem ferarum,</hi> onely, and for that cauſe, a man may not buyld a Mill in the Foreſt, becauſe the ſame is <hi>ad terrorem ferarum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 Fiftly, It is not lawfull for any Purlieu hunter to hunt in the Purlieus with any more company than with his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, becauſe that the Lawes of the foreſt doe not allowe of multitudes of people to aſſemble themſelues toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:27422:98"/> to hunte with him: for to hunte and kill his Deare there is a thing of profit and of pleaſure all. And it is helde for a learning in our Lawe, that he that hath a licence or an intereſt of profit,<note place="margin">Vide le caſe in 13. H. 7. ſ. 13. ante pag. 54,</note> he may iuſtifie for himſelfe and for his Seruantes alſo.

                  <p>And it is to be vnderſtood, that in times paſt, when the Foreſt Lawes were carefully put in execution: then the generall Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Foreſt called the Seate of the Lord Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt was holden and kept euery thirde yeare.

                  </p>
                  <p>I do finde by the Lawes and cuſtomes of the Foreſt, that there may be three ſorts of Regarders of the Foreſt, which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:27422:102"/>
                  <p>And now, foraſmuch as it appeareth by the writt aforeſaid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Shirife to chooſe new Regarders in the place of ſuch as are dead: And that the ſame Shirife according to his writt muſt giue vnto ſuch Regarders as he ſhall chooſe in their places,<note place="margin">A Regarder muſt be ſworne.</note> an othe (for the wordes of the writt are theſe. <hi>Et dicti mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites Iurent quod facient regardum ſicut ſolet &amp; debet fieri</hi>) Now therfore it is neceſſarie to ſee what the oath of a Regarder is.

And becauſe that the ſaid King H. 2. would haue his Foreſtes the better kept and looked vnto, he did ordaine that certaine Regarders ſhould be appointed in euery Foreſt throughout his whole Realme, for to ſuruey the Foreſts as it doth appeare by the Aſſiſes of the Foreſt made in his time: where he doth ſay as followeth, <hi>Item Dominus Rex precipit quod in quolibet Comitatu in quo habet venationem ponantur duodecim milites ad cuſtodiendum Venationem ſuam &amp; viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in Foreſta:</hi>

And alſo it appeareth by the Aſſiſes of the Foreſt <hi>domini Wilhelmi Veyſey</hi> made in the fifteenth yeare of the raigne of King Edward the firſt,<note place="margin">Aſſiſa domini Wilhelmi Veyſey, anno 15.

                  <p>And it is to be noted, that in euery Foreſt of the Kings, or in the greateſt part of them, there are certaine woods that are the Kings owne demeane woods belonging to the Crowne, and the King hath the regarde of all the woods and waſte grounds and other lands which are afforeſted and within the boundes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes of the Foreſt, aſwell thoſe that are not the Kings owne woods, as thoſe that are the Kings owne woods.

                  <p>But now it is neceſſarie here in this place to ſpeake ſomthing concerning the manner of the ſame Certificat. And therefore firſt of all it is to be vnderſtood that in this Certificat there are two things moſt eſpecially to be obſerued, that is to ſaye:</p>
                  <p>The number of the Regarders that muſt certifie the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And that they do Certifie the ſame vpon their view: and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>It hath beene ſhewed alreadie before: that by the Lawes and Aſſiſes of the Foreſt,<note place="margin">Aſſiſa Foreſtae H. 2.</note> made in the time of King H. 2. that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie there muſt be twelue Regarders in euery foreſt. And it doth alſo appeare by the writ aforeſaid, that if any of thoſe twelue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garders be dead or ſick, there muſt be others choſen in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſerue: So that of neceſſitie there muſt be the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twelue Regarders in euery Foreſt, or elſe they cannot make the Regard of the foreſt, nor make any certificat therof. For if the certificat of their inquiſition bee made by 11. of the Regarders of the foreſt: then that certificat is not a ſufficient certificat to charge any offender to anſwer therevnto,<note place="margin">Vide maſter Hesket in his reading, fo. 25.</note> for as much as it doth appeare by matter of recorde, that the ſame certificat was not made by all the Regarders of the foreſt: for it muſt be intended that there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies 12. Regarders, and the certificat of their inquiſition muſt be made by all the Regarders, that is to ſaie, by 12. Regarders. And this much concerning the number of the Regarders that muſt certifie.</p>
                  <p>Nowe concerning the certifying of their inquiſition vpon their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:27422:106"/> owne view. It is to be vnderſtood, that if it do not appeare in their certificat before the Lord chiefe Iuſtice of the Foreſt, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardors did raunge and goe thorow all the Foreſt,<note place="margin">Maſter Heske<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> fo 25.</note> to ſée and vewe the Foreſt, and the offences and treſpaſſes of the Foreſt, which they do certifie: Then that certificat or preſentment, although that they as Regarders of the Foreſt doe certifie their preſentment of an offence of the Foreſt within their charge:<note place="margin">Vide the caſe 34. H. 6.</note> yet that certificat is not good, neither ſhall the offender or dooer of ſuch a treſpaſſe bee impeched vpon that preſentment, but the Regarders ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merced for their inſufficient certificat. For in this caſe their certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat is like to the return of the Shirife in an Action of waſt, where the Shirife doth leaue out of his retorne (theſe wordes:) <hi>Acceſsi ad locum vaſtatum, vt patet in An.</hi> 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. And alſo it is like to the preſentment of the Coroner that doth not make mention that the inquiſition of the Coroner was taken <hi>ſuper viſum corporis.</hi> But if in the Certificat of the Regarders mention be made of their Perambulation through the Foreſt, and vew of the treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that they do preſent or certifie: wheras in the verie truth they did not Perambulat nor vew the ſame: yet that preſentment and Certificat of any ſuch offences as they ſhall ſo certifie is good and ſufficient in law. For a man cannot by the law trauers the retorne or Certificat of an officer that is ſworn. But here it doth appeare that the office and dutie of a Regarder is, to goe and vewe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and treſpaſſes of the Foreſt: and they muſt alſo certifie their vewe: and it is not ſufficient for one or two of them to vewe the ſame, but they muſt all vewe the Foreſt, and the offences or treſpaſſes that are done in the foreſt: euen ſo they muſt all certifie the ſame as their verdict or preſentment. For as a Iurie at the common lawe, if 11. of them be agréed of their verdict, and they doe giue a verdict, and one of them will not agrée to it: then their verdict is no verdict at all in Lawe. So it is, if 11. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garders do certifie, and the twelfth wil not certifie: the Certificat of the other 11. is voide and no certificat at all: for as much as it doth appeare by matter of Record, that their certificat was not made by all the Regarders, as by law it ought to be. And thus
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:27422:107"/> much concerning the Seconde, poynt that the Regarders muſt make mention in their Certificat, that the ſame was made and done vpon their owne vew, that is, vpon all their vewes: So that nowe you ſee that by the letter of the Statute in theſe wordes: <hi>Regardatores noſtri eant per Foreſtam:</hi> It is ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted that the Regarders ſhall goe through out all the Foreſt: and then afterwardes in theſe wordes: <hi>Ad faciendum Regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> It is ſhewed and declared to what end, or for what cauſe they ought to goe through the Foreſt: which is, to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the Foreſt. And afterwardes the letter is further: <hi>Sicut fieri conſueuit tempore primae Coronationis Regis H. aui noſtri &amp; non aliter:</hi> In which wordes it is playnly ſet downe and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, how and in what manner the Regarders ſhall make their regarde of the Foreſt, which is according to the aſſiſes and cuſtomes of the Foreſt vſed in the time of King Henry the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: ſo that this braunch of the ſaide Statute doth not hereby or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne or appoynt any new thing that was not before. But this braunch is made for an affirmation of the lawe and vſage of the Foreſt that was vſed in the time of King H. 2. Now therefore it is neceſſarie here in this place to ſhew how and in what manner the lawe and vſage of the Foreſt was at that time vſed in making of the regarde of the Foreſt. For the declaration whereof, it is to be vnderſtood, that the inquitie and preſentment of all the Articles aforeſaid, which are to be inquired of by the Regarders of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the ſame ſhall be enquired of as they were wont to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, at the time of the Coronation of King H 2. and that is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry third yeare, as it doth appeare in the Aſſiſes of King H. 2. and then the ſame regarde is to be made but onely within the bounds of the Foreſt:<note place="margin">Aſſiſa Foreſtae H. 2. C. 10. &amp; 17.</note> for the ſaide Regarders ought not to enquire nor to preſent any thing that is made or done out of the boundes of the Foreſt, nor yet out of the precinct of the regarde within the foreſt, as it doth appeare in the ſame Aſſiſes of H. 2. Cap. 10. and 17. For it is there written, that thoſe that haue Woodes out of the regarde of the Foreſt, where the wilde beaſtes of the King haue their haunt, peace or reſt: Or any other man that hath landes or
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:27422:107"/> Woodes within the Foreſt, and hath alſo this Priuiledge, that thoſe landes and woodes ſhalbe out of the regarde of the Foreſt: and that the ſame ſhall not be impeched for any cauſe: yet in that caſe he or they that haue ſuch a Priuiledge, ought to haue a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde there to keepe his woodes, which woodwarde muſt alſo be ſworne to the aſſiſes of the Foreſt, that is,<note place="margin">Aſſiſa Foreſtae H. 2 Vide Maſter Hesket fo. 26.</note> for the preſeruation of Vert and Veniſon, as it doth appeare by the ſame aſſiſes of H. 2. And if the Regarders doe enquire or make any preſentment of any thing that is done in any ſuch place Priuileged, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide: then that preſentment may be auoyded by the plee of the partie, by pleading of that matter: For the partie ſhall neuer bee puniſhed vpon ſuch a preſentment if the verie trueth of the matter doe appeare of recorde vnto the high Court of the Lord Iuſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame lawe is alſo, if the Regarders of the Foreſt will make preſentment of any Article that is not ſpecified <hi>in dictis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulis de regardo fiendo:</hi> (which is alwaies ſent to the Shirife, together with the writ, when the regarde is to be made as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide,) as if they do preſent, that Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> hath agiſted his woodes or his demeaſne landes, before that the demeaſne hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the King within the Foreſt be agyſted: or that he hath taken any pannage contrarie to the aſſiſes of the Foreſt: then that preſentment is voyd without any plee, if that it doe appeare vnto the Court by matter of record compriſed within the ſame preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the thing of the which they haue made their preſentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not any matter whereof they had charge giuen them to enquire of, or to preſent.</p>
                  <p>And if the regard of the Foreſt, be made by the Regarders that are elected by writ, and yet they haue not any writ to make their regarde when they do make the ſame, but they doe make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Foreſt of themſelues voluntarily,<note place="margin">Preſentment per le Regard ſans authoritie eſt void.</note> within the tyme of thrée yeares, that is to ſaie, euerie yeare: that regard, and alſo the preſentmentes made by the ſame regarde againſt any perſon are alſo voide: and the partie againſt whom any ſuch preſentment is made, may diſcharge himſelfe of that preſentment by plee.</p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:27422:108"/>
                  <p>But ſuch a preſentment and inquirie made by the Regarders which were once elected and choſen, although that they doe make their regarde euerie fourth yeare or euerie fifth yeare, it is good &amp; ſufficient in lawe, and the ſame ſhall binde the partie to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithſtanding that euerie ſuch preſentment and regarde by them made, was not by a commaundement directed to the Shirife as aforeſaide: For when the Regarders are once elected by writt and Sworne, then they may hold their regard according to the aſſiſes of the Foreſt, that is to ſaie, euerie third yeare <hi>ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> without any new writ, precept, or comaundement. But if any of them be dead, ſo that there are not the whole number of 12. Regarders lyuing, then they ought to haue a writ as is aforeſaid, to chuſe newe Regarders in their places, to make vpp the full number of 12. Regarders againe, before that they can make their regarde of the Foreſt. And ſo in like manner it is if the King by his letters patens doe make one or more Regardors to fill vp the number of 12. Regarders againe, they cannot <hi>ex officio,</hi> make the regarde of the Foreſt without ſuch a writ <hi>vt ſupra,</hi>

                  <p>The letter is further in the 6. branch of the ſaid Statute as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>vz, Inquiſitio vel viſus expeditatione canum exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium in Foreſta noſtra de cetero fiat quando fieri debet regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ſcilicet de tercio anno in tertium annum:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Carta de Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſta. cap. 6.</note> By which words of the ſaid Statute, there are two things eſpecially to be noted: Firſt, that the regard of the Foreſt ought to be made euery thirde yeare. Secondly, the time when all the Dogges in the Foreſt ought to be viewed whether that they be expeditated or not: and then all the Dogges that are found to be vnexpeditated, they muſt be expedicated according to this law. And this is alſo to be done euery thirde yeare, when the Regarders do make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>And then the letter is further as followeth, <hi>Et tunc fiat per
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:27422:108"/> viſum &amp; teſtimonium legalium hominum, et non aliter.</hi> In theſe words of the ſaid Statute it is plainly ſet downe,<note place="margin">The Regard of the Foreſt ought to be made euery third yeare.</note> how the expeditating of Dogges within the Foreſt ſhalbe made, which is by the view and teſtimonie of good and lawfull men: So that it doth hereby appeare, that before there can be any expeditating of dogges within the Foreſt, there muſt be an inquiſition and view taken throughout all the Foreſt by the Regarders of the ſame Foreſt, to the ende that thereby it may firſt appeare by matter of Record to the Court, what manner of Dogges they are that are vnexpeditated within the Foreſt. For ſome Dogges are not to be expeditated, as Greyhounds and ſuch like: for they may not be kept within the Foreſt although that they were expeditated: for no Dogges ſhalbe expeditated but onely the Maſtife or the Mungrell of the Maſtifes kynde: and of ſuch kinde of Dogges it is that the Statute doth meane. And alſo who is the proper owner of ſuch Dogges as are ſo remaining within the Foreſt vnexpeditated, to the ende that they onely who are the proper owners of ſuch Dogges, may be compelled to paye the fyne for the ſame offence. And then when the ſame Regarders haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch view and inquiſition of ſuch Dogges, as is aforeſaide, the ſame muſt be certified and returned by the certificat and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the ſaid Regarders of the Foreſt. And this is the meaning of theſe wordes, <hi>Per viſum &amp; teſtimonium legalium hominum,</hi> And in this ſort the expeditating of Dogges muſt be made. And if it be made otherwiſe, then the ſame is void by thoſe wordes <hi>et non aliter.</hi> Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> in his reading of the lawes of the Foreſt vpon the words aforeſaid, ſaith as followeth. It appeareth, ſaith he, by the letter of the Statute aforeſaid, that the inquirie and view of the expeditating of dogges ſhalbe made when the regard is made by the ſame Regarders as one Article and parcell of their charge: and that doeth appeare to be euery third yeare: And that then the ſame ſhalbe done by the view and teſtimonie of good and lawfull men, and that is, ſaith he, by the view and teſtimonie of the ſame Regarders. And he ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that before the making of that Charter of the liberties of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:27422:109"/> the Foreſt, the law of the Foreſt was, that expeditating of doggs ſhould be made whereſoeuer the wilde Beaſtes of the King haue their peace and reſt, and haue vſed to haue their peace and reſt, as it doth appeare in the Aſſiſes of the Foreſt, made in the time of H 2. Cap, 11. But ſaith he, the certeintie of the expeditating of Dogges was not knowen nor expreſſed vntill that this Charter of the Liberties of the Foreſt was made, which now doth declare and expreſſe the certeintie of fiue things that were not certaine before,<note place="margin">Fiue things are put in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie by the Statute.</note> that is to ſaye: How the ſame ſhalbe done. At what time the ſame ſhalbe done. In what manner the ſame ſhalbe done. Who ſhall do it. And the certaintie of the fyne or amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement of the offender.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be vnderſtood, that although the expeditating of Dogges be one of the Articles of the Charter <hi>De Regardo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,</hi> as it doth appeare there, Cap. 13. Yet the letter of this Statute here hath not now made the lawe ſo ſtraite that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie the inquirie of the expeditating of Dogges muſt be made in the Court of the Regard onely, and not otherwiſe. For it doeth appeare that the Iuſtices of the Foreſt in their generall Seſſions may inquire and determine that matter alſo. And ſo likewiſe the expeditating of Dogges may be inquired and determined at the Courts of the Foreſt called the Swanimotes, as it doth appeare by the charge of the Courtes: But that is onely by the preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Inqueſt, and then that preſentment muſt be affirmed by the Foreſters, Regarders, and all other officers and miniſters of the Foreſt before the Iuſtices of the Foreſt, the expeditating of Dogges ſhalbe inquired onely by a Iurie or Enqueſt. And in that Court of Regard it ſhall not be onely inquired, of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of Dogges by the Regarders: But they onely ought to haue the view of that matter when that they do make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde vpon the ſaid view and perambulation, or otherwiſe, the ſame is a voide inquirie and preſentment by them vpon thoſe wordes aforeſaid, <hi>Et non aliter,</hi> Which words ſhall haue relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that intent onely, and not to the time, nor to the Court where the Articles ſhalbe enquired. For that preſentment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garders
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27422:109"/> ſhalbe made vpon the view of the Dogges only, euen as the preſentment of the Coroner ſhalbe made <hi>ſuper viſum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi> although that the letter of the ſame Statut be in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiue <hi>Inquiſitio vel viſus.</hi> For this is helde for a learning in the Lawes of the Foreſt:<note place="margin">In euery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the Regarders, it ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Record that they had the view.</note> that nothing is lawfully preſented by the Regarders of the Foreſt, if it do not appeare by matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde that they had the view of the ſame in their perambulation. And Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> noteth further, that by the letter of the ſaide Statute, there is full authoritie and power giuen to the Regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to inquire and determine that Article for and concerning the hameling of Dogges. For before the making of this Charter of the Liberties of the foreſt: The Regarders did not meddle in this Article, but onely with Waſtes, Aſſarts, purpreſtures, and ſuch like within their regard onely, as it doth appeare in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes of the foreſt of H. 2. Cap. 10. And now by the letter of the Charter of the foreſt aforeſaid, the Lawe is inlarged greatly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this Articles, more than it is concerning any other Article of the Regard of the foreſt. For the Regarders cannot procéede any further in any other Article of the Regard in their charge, but onely to view and inquire of them, and then to inroll their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments: and then when they haue ſo done, they muſt alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye that preſentment before the Iuſtices of the foreſt, at their comming into the foreſt, when they do holde the generall Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the foreſt, and then there the offences that they haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſhalbe determined. And before that time nothing ſhalbe done by Proces or otherwiſe: But all the preſentments ſhall lye dead vntill then. But otherwiſe it is of that Article of Expedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Dogges: for that the Regarders haue authoritie to heare and determine the fyne or amercement for that matter onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the fyne is alreadie by the ſaide Charter ſet down and made certaine. The words of the Statut are further as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Et ille cuius canis inuentus fuerit tunc non expeditatus det pro miſericordia tres ſolidos.</hi> By theſe wordes of the Charter aforeſaid, here are two things eſpecially to be noted. The firſt is, that it muſt be found by the inquiſition and view of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garders,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:27422:110"/> what maner of Dogg it is that is vnexpeditated. And who is the owner of the ſame Dogg, that is by Law to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the fyne or amercement for the ſame. The ſecond is, that he whoſe Dogg the ſame is, ſhall paye for his amercement 3. s. which is certaine:<note place="margin">Maſter Hesket fo. 27.</note> So that now the certaintie of the fyne or amercement is here ſpecified and declared, and who ſhalbe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the ſame. But (ſaith Maſter <hi>Hesket</hi>) it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the ſame 3. s. ſhalbe taken or leuyed vpon the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the view and inquirie which ſhalbe done ſo ſoone as the regard is made, as is aforeſaide, and their view and inquirie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of recorde. Then, if in caſe that the Regarders by their view and preſentment do finde and preſent one Maſtiffe within the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which is not hameled or expeditated according to the Lawes of the foreſt: And they ſay further in their preſentment, <hi>quod ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant' cuius Canis ille eſt,</hi> that is a voide preſentment, If that there be no other wordes afterwardes to helpe the ſame: but yet neuertheleſſe the ſame dogg ſhalbe taken and kept by the officers of the foreſt, or elſe auoided away cleane from the foreſt, if no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will claime the ſame dogg. And if that any perſon do claime the ſame dogg by Accion of treſpaſſe, or repleui, or otherwiſe by matter of recorde, as a man may verie well as it ſéemeth, and the ſame Accion is tryed and thereby proued to be his Dogg that ſo did claime him: Then vpon that tryall and vpon the firſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſame owner ſhalbe amerced to the King thrée ſhillings, according to the ſaide Charter of the foreſt.</p>
                  <p>And if the: Regarders doe finde and preſent one dogg <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> which is the dogg of one Iohn <hi>Aſtile:</hi> that is a good indictment: and the ſaide Iohn <hi>Aſtile</hi> cannot diſclaime nor ſaie that the ſame is not his dogg generally: and the cauſe is as Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> &amp; Maiſter <hi>Treherne</hi> do think by reaſon of the letter of the Statut, which is, <hi>quod ille cuius tunc inuentus fuerit &amp;c.</hi> So that if it be there ſo found by matter of record for the king: then Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> ſhall paye his amercement: for he cannot counterplede that poynt generally againſt the preſentment or returne of the officers of the king, that are ſworne.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:27422:110"/>
                  <p>And if a man be indited that he did kéepe one Dogg of one Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> within the Foreſt not hameled, contrary to the lawes of the Foreſt: If before the Iuſtices of the Foreſt he doe plede that the dogg is not his: that is no plee without ſaying to whome the propertie of the dogg is, as to Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> &amp;c. And if the Iurie do finde that the propertie of the dogg is not to the ſaid Iohn <hi>Aſtyle,</hi> nor yet vnto Iohn <hi>Adowne:</hi> that is no ſufficient verdict, without finding to what other perſon the propertie of the dogg was. For in that caſe it is like to a man that is indicted by the Coroner, <hi>ſuper viſum corporis,</hi> and he doth plede not guiltie: and ſo it is found by the Iury that he is not guiltie: yet that is no ſufficient verdict without preſenting one other perſon that did the murder, which preſentment ſhalbe in the nature of an enditement againſt him: ſo that if he plede not guiltie, that is no plee, nor yet to finde him not guiltie, is not any verdict againſt ſuch a preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>vt ſupra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Regarders doe finde and preſent ſuch a Dogg at the houſe or in the houſe of Iohn <hi>A downe</hi> within the Foreſt: yet that Iohn <hi>Adowne</hi> ſhall not bee amerced by reaſon of ſuch a preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſuch a Dogg within the Foreſt: that is a good preſentment for to charge Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> with the amercement of that Statute. But if the Regarders doe finde and preſent that Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one Dogg to Iohn <hi>Adowne,</hi> to keepe within the Foreſt: and that he kept that dogg there: In that caſe the deliuerer or bayler ſhalbe charged vpon that preſentment and amercement according to the ſaide Charter, and not the baylee or he to whome the dogg was deliuered.</p>
                  <p>But if the Regarders doe finde and preſent that Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> did deliuer the ſaide dogg for a certaine time to keepe vnto Iohn <hi>Adowne,</hi> which Iohn <hi>Adowne</hi> did keepe the ſame dogg within the Foreſt not hameled. There both the bayler and the baylee ſhal be amerced. But if it be found that the dogg that was ſo deliuered was a pledge or a morgage for money <hi>vt ſupra:</hi> there he to whom the dogg was delyuered onely ſhalbe charged of the amercement,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:27422:111"/> and not the baylor.</p>
                  <p>And if it bee found and preſented that Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> as a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſer, <hi>vi et armis,</hi> did take the dogg of one Iohn <hi>Adowne,</hi> and did keepe him within the Foreſt not expeditated: Iohn <hi>Adowne</hi> the owner ſhalbe charged of the amercement, &amp; not Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> the treſpaſſer. So it is if it be preſented that Iohn <hi>Aſtyle vi et armis,</hi> doe take the dogg of one Iohn <hi>Adowne</hi> from him: And he vpon that brought a repleuie, and that Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> ſo kept that dogg within the foreſt not expeditated: There Iohn <hi>Adowne</hi> the verie owner of the dogg onely ſhall be charged of the amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> that kept his dogg. Nowe the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Statute is:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Det pro miſericordia tres ſolidos.</head>
                  <p>So that if it be preſented and founde that one Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> hath 2. doggs within the Foreſt not expeditated: he ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merced for euerie dogg thrée ſhillings, but onely thrée ſhillings for all the offence. But if two men haue ioyntly or in common one dogg within the Foreſt not expeditated: There euery one of them ſhalbe amerced to three ſhillings ſeuerally.</p>
                  <p>But otherwiſe it is if it be founde and preſented that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife haue one dogg, by reaſon that the wife is executrix to him to whome the dog was belonging: There the huſband only ſhalbe amerced but to three ſhillings.</p>
                  <p>And if it be found by the Regarders of the foreſt, in their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: that a Duke, an Earle, a Baron, or any other perſon of the Realme, Spirituall or Temporall, doe keepe ſuch a dogg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Foreſt vnexpeditated: he ſhall pay but onely the amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of three ſhillings, according to the letter of the Charter of the liberties of the Foreſt, and not any amercement according to his dignitie and degree as they doe at the common lawe. But if ſuch a great perſon of dignitie or honor be preſented and indicted for the keeping of ſuch doggs before the Iuſtices of the Foreſt: there they ſhalbe out of the remedy and Priuiledge of that letter, and then they ſhalbe amerced for the ſame by the Iuſtices of the Foreſt at their diſcretion,<note place="margin">Hesket fo. 28.</note> according to their dignitie and eſtate</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:27422:111"/>
                  <p>And it is to be noted vpon that word <hi>Det,</hi> that the ſaid amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of three ſhillings ſhalbe leuied by diſtreſſe, preſently before the comming of the Iuſtices of the Foreſt. For in this caſe the ſame is like to the amercement of a Leete, as it doth appeare by the rolles &amp; preſentmentes of the Regarders in diuers Foreſtes. And ſo you may ſee that this Article for the inquiſition and view of expeditating of doggs doth differ from euerie other Article of the regarde: For the Regarders themſelues may ceſſe the fine concerning this Article: And the ſame fine ſhalbe leuied preſently by the Foreſters of the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>So that now you may perceiue by the verie conſtruction of the letter of the Statute aforeſaide, that the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Et ille cuius canis inuentus fuerit tunc no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expeditatus det pro miſericordia tres ſolidos,</hi> is as much as to ſaie: that hee whoſe dogg is founde by the inquiſition &amp; view of the Regarders, and by their certificat preſented to be vnexpeditated, he ſhal pay 3. s. for a fyne for his dogg: and yet neuertheleſſe he muſt haue his dogg expeditated, if he will keepe his dogg within the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the words are further, <hi>Et de cetero nullus bos capiatur pro expeditatione canum:</hi> By theſe words it doth appeare, that before the making of this Charter of the Liberties of the Foreſt, it was then an vſuall thing, that for euery default or offence of the Foreſt, the Foreſters would diſtraine his Oxe, which often times was of a great price. And ſometimes alſo the ſame was done of malice and euill will, to vexe and trouble the offenders without any iuſt or lawfull cauſe. And therefore this Article of the ſaide Charter hath greatly mittigated that great amercement &amp; vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath here ſet downe a reaſonable amercement, that is to ſay, thrée ſhillings: and doth now prohibit that from hencefoorth no Oxe ſhalbe taken for the expeditating of any Dogges.</p>
                  <p>Then the wordes are further as followeth, <hi>Talis autem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditio fiat per Aſsiſam communiter vſitatum videlicet quod tres ortelli abſcindantur ſine pellota de pede anteriori:</hi> In theſe words here is ſet downe and declared what manner of expedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Dogges hath beene vſed heretofore by the auncient Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

And alſo here is further added to it a confirmation, that is to ſaye: that the ſame manner of expeditating of Dogges ſhall be ſtill vſed &amp; kept, and no other manner of expeditating of Dogges.</p>
                  <p>The words are further, <hi>Nec expeditentur Canes de cetero niſi in locis vbi conſueuerunt Expeditari tempore primae Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronationis praedicti Regis Henrici aui noſtri.</hi>

                  <p>The ſame lawe is if a man haue lycence to incloſe his lande where the wilde beaſtes of the King onely at the tyme of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation vſe to haue their haunte and reſt: and he doth incloſe the ſame land with ſtone walles:<note place="margin">Expeditating of Doggs.</note> ſo that the wilde beaſtes cannot haue their haunt there, by reaſon whereof they do chaunge their haunt and reſt, and doe reſort to ſome other place whereas they did not vſe at the time of the Coronation: yet there ſhall be hameling of dogs: Notwithſtanding the words of the Statut are as aforeſaid. And the like lawe is of the contrarie parte. For if the place where the wilde beaſtes haue had their haunte and reſt at the tyme of the ſaide Coronation: And where at that time there were hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng and expeditating of Doggs vſed:<note place="margin">Hameling of Doggs.</note> If afterwardes the ſame place be diſaforeſted? then after ſuch diſaforeſting of the ſame, ther ſhall not be expeditating of doggs any more vſed: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that expeditating of doggs was vſed there at the tyme of

                  <p>The ſame law is if the king do graunt to Iohn <hi>Aſtile</hi> a francke Chaſe through out all his landes within the Foreſt of the King, and within thoſe landes the wilde beaſtes haue vſed to haue their haunt and reſt vpon that lande, and before that graunt made, there was alwaies halmeling of doggs vſed: Yet now in this place the doggs of Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> the grauntée of the king ſhall not be hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, although the contrarie were vſed at the time of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>The ſame lawe ſhalbe where the king doth graunte lycence to Iohn <hi>Aſtyle</hi> to make a Parke, &amp; to imparke certaine of his lands within the Foreſt, and he ſhall haue the Priuiledge of a Parke and Saltarie there, and he doth make the ſame Parke and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, according to his graunt: in which place before that tyme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditating or hameling of doggs was vſed <hi>vt ſupra:</hi> there his doggs within the Parke ſhall not be hameled: but in neither of theſe two laſt caſes the doggs of any other perſon, be it his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant or other ſtraunger, they ought to be hameled within that Parke or Cloſe.

Which ſaide myſchiefe and oppreſſions doe ſéeme by this Statute to be two foulde, that is to ſaie. Firſt the extortions of the Foreſters and other officers of the Foreſt. And Secondly, the multitude of thoſe officers by whome they were ſo oppreſſed: and as the myſchiefes at the tyme of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Statute were two folde: ſo the prouiſion and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of this Statute is twofolde likewiſe.

                  <p>That is to ſaye: that no Officer of the Foreſt ſhal by coulor of his office onely make any

                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is to be ſéene what thing Scottall or Scottale is. And for that it is to be vnderſtood that a Scottal or Scottale is, where any officer of the Foreſt doth keepe an Ale-houſe within the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,<note place="margin">A Scotale is a kinde of extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> whereas he is an officer and by color of his office doth cauſe men to come to his houſe, and there to ſpend their Money, for feare of hauing his diſpleaſure: this is called a Scottall, &amp; this is to be inquired of, <hi>per duodecim iuratores</hi> at the Swanimote, and alſo at the generall Seſſions of the Foreſt. And if ſuch a Foreſter or officer of the Foreſt be attaynted of any ſuch offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then he is to be puniſhed for the ſaid offence, and alſo to be put from his ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And the like lawe is, where any Foreſter or other officer of the Foreſt doth kéepe any game, or ſell any Ale at a certayne daie, and by color of his office doth cauſe the people to ſpend their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with him: this is alſo a Scottale. But if a Foreſter or other officer of the Foreſt be robbed, or haue his houſe broken or burned by miſchaunce, ſo that by thoſe meanes he is vndone, and he doth deſire the people of the Foreſt for his releefe, to come and drinke with him, and to giue him their money for charities ſake. This is no Scottall,<note place="margin">Colori officij virtute officij.</note> nor yet any extortion: for a Scottall is extortion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame is taken <hi>Colore officij,</hi> &amp; not <hi>virtute officij.</hi> But whatſoeuer is taken <hi>virtute officij,</hi> is not extortion: Note the difference.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner it is, if any Foreſter or other officer of the Foreſt, by coulor of his office onely do oppreſſe the people of the Foreſt that haue any common of paſture within the ſame foreſt: and do ſecretly compell them, in reſpect to haue his fauour, to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:27422:114"/> giue them Hay or Oates, or any other Corne, or Lambs or Pigges:<note place="margin">It appeareth by the worde, (de cetero) that before the making of this Statute, theſe extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were vſed.</note> or doe make any manner of collection for any Mony or any other things: This is extortion, and is now prohibited by the Statute to be vſed any more hereafter: For the wordes are <hi>de cetero,</hi> that is to ſaie, from hencefoorth, that is, from the making of this Statut, ſuch things ſhal not be vſed. And if any officer of the Foreſt do vſe any ſuch Scottall or gathering now at this daie, the ſame is extortion by the lawe, and the offender therein is to be puniſhed for the ſame as an extortioner in this caſe. And then it followeth with a further addition vnto it: <hi>Per viſum et ſacramentum duodecim regardatorum quando faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent regardum:</hi> ſo that although the making of Scottales and gathering of Hey or Oates, or any other Corne, or Lambs or Piggs, or making of any manner of collection by any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter or officer of the Foreſt, is vnlawful in ſome caſes: (as where any ſuch thing is newly exacted vpon the people of the Foreſt without any good tytle or right to the ſame:) yet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome caſes al thoſe things that are here prohibited and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by this Statute may be lawfull, ſo that the ſame, vſage had his begynning by good and lawfull tytle, which may be in three ſortes which are as followeth.</p>
                  <list>

                     <item>3 By Preſcription.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt is, by Tenure, as where a man doth hold cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lande of the Kings within the Foreſt,<note place="margin">By Tenure.</note> to paye vnto any officer of the Foreſt euery yeare at his Scottall xii. d. or. v. s. or one Sheepe or Lambe: this is not extortion nor within the letter of this Statute, for this is not done <hi>Colori officij,</hi> that is by color of his office onely without any other right or ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this caſe if the donee will not paye nor delyuer the ſayde collection accordingly, the foreſters or other officers of the Foreſt haue not any remeadie by the law to compell the ſaid donee to paie the ſaide collection. But otherwiſe it is of the King himſelfe, for he may by endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reſpect of his right of the Foreſt haue remedie: And in this caſe the donor himſelfe may compel him by diſtreſſe to pay the ſaide collection vnto the ſaide officers of the Foreſt: And notwithſtanding that the donee do paye the ſame collection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the donor, and not vnto the ſaid officers of the Foreſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenure, yet that donee ſhall not be diſcharged by that payment, but that the donor may in this caſe diſtrayne the donee a new for his ſeruice not done.</p>

                  <p>A Foreſter in fee may preſcribe in him &amp; his anceſters to haue three halfe pence euery daie throughout the whole yeare, <hi>pro victu ſuo,</hi> &amp; he may lawfully gather the ſame, notwithſtanding the prohibition of the ſaid Statute.<note place="margin">Hesket f. 30.

                  <p>And whereas the words of the Statute are <hi>Niſi per viſum &amp; Sacramentum duodecem regardatorum.</hi> It is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that theſe words do permit and ſuffer ſome ſort of ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and collections made by the Foreſters and other officers of the Foreſt to remaine and continue ſtill at this daye: So that the ſame be ſuch Scottals or collections as had a lawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the firſt, as hath beene ſhewed before, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie muſt be in one of thoſe three degrees aforeſaid.

But now for the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the word diſtreſſe, I wil here ſpeake ſomthing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the ſame: And where diſtreſſes may be lawfully made &amp; taken, in ſuch caſes which doe concerne Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimotes: and what things may lawfully be had or taken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution for diſtreſſes. And for that it is to be vnderſtood, that if an officer of the Foreſt do make default at any Court of Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimote, then the chief Warden of the Foreſt or his Lieutenant or the Bedell of the Foreſt may deſtraine him for that amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of three ſhillings, or more or leſſe, in any land that hee hath, or doth hold by reaſon of his office, if he do hold any land ſo. And in the like maner, he may diſtrayne any other land that he hath within the Foreſt, although that the ſame doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto his office: but he cannot diſtraine him out of the Foreſt in his landes: but he may diſtraine the goodes or Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of that officer,<note place="margin">How diſtreſſes ought to be taken.</note> although that they be in the landes of any other man within the Foreſt. And the ſame lawe is of euery other man that ought to appeare at the ſaid Courtes of Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimote, as the foure men and the Reue, Baylife, Conſtable, Tithingman, Free-holder, of Iuror which is Sommoned to appeare at the ſaid Court of Swanimot, to be of any Iury for the Queenes Maieſtie, or any other ſeruice there as in the caſe is afore ſaid. And if the ſaid chief Warden of the Foreſt, or his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27422:119"/> Lieutenant, or the ſaide Bedell of the Foreſt, which ought to diſtraine, cannot find any diſtreſſe of his within the Foreſt, then he ought to certifie the ſame before the Iuſtices of the Foreſts: and vpon a <hi>Teſtatum</hi> there, that ſuch a perſon which ought to appeare at the Court of Swanimote in ſuch a foreſt did make default, and for the ſame he was amerced, and that he hath not any lands nor goods within the Foreſt that he may be diſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by, but that he hath ſufficient landes within ſuch a County which is out of the Foreſt: then vpon that <hi>Teſtatum</hi> there ſhall goe a write or precept to the Shirife of the ſaid foren Countie which is out of the Foreſt, where he hath ſufficient of landes, <hi>ad diſtringendum terras et tenementa cuiuſmodi A.

                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Bedell of the Foreſt or other officer do come to diſtraine for ſuch an amercement in the Foreſt, and the owner of the ſame goods, (which are to be diſtrained) knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by couine doth come before that the ſaid Bedell or other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer hath diſtrained them and doth conuey them away out of the foreſt: in this caſe, although that ſuch an officer do freſhly purſue them: yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not lawfully take thoſe goods nor diſtraine them being out of the bounds of the foreſt. But if ſuch an officer had taken and once ſeiſed the beaſtes of the defaulter for ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercement lawfully as a diſtreſſe, and then the owner by force had taken them from him, and ſo driue them out of the Foreſt: then the ſaid Bedell or officer may make hue and crye &amp; freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſue after him, and ſo take thoſe beaſtes from the ſaid reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſor in any place whereſoeuer out of the Foreſt. And the ſame
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:27422:120"/> law is, if a ſtraunger do take thoſe beaſtes from the Bedell or officer after that he hath diſtrained them, and then doth deliuer them to the firſt owner againe which doth driue them out of the Foreſt: then the ſaide Bedell or officer may lawfully purſue them and take then againe. But if that the beaſtes diſtrained <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> do come backe to the owner againe into his land, that is out of the bounds of the Foreſt by the negligence of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell or officer that ought to haue impounded them, then the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer cannot take them againe:<note place="margin">Maſter Mesket Fo. 38.</note> For now the firſt diſtreſſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the comming backe againe of thoſe beaſtes to the firſt owner, which is done without his act: for in this caſe it is not like to a reſcous, where the owner of thoſe beaſtes doeth come to the poſſeſſion of them againe by his owne wrong.</p>
                  <p>But if the Bedell or other officer do diſtraine for any amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> and then doth deliuer the ſame beaſtes which he hath taken by diſtreſſe to a ſtraunger to keepe to his owne vſe, whereby the ſtraunger to whome they were deliuered ſo to keepe, doth driue them to his owne land being within the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: and afterwards the owner of thoſe beaſtes doth take them out of his land that hath the keeping of them, and driue them out of the Foreſt: in this caſe the Bedell nor other officer can not take them againe now being out of the Foreſt. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is, if that the Bedell or other officer had taken the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe and deliuered the beaſtes vnto a ſtraunger to keepe as a diſtreſſe: In this caſe, if the owner take them &amp; do driue them out of the Foreſt, yet the Bedell or other officer may freſhly purſue them &amp; take them againe from him although that they be without the Foreſt in a forreine Countie. Note the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence where ſuch beaſts were deliuered to be kept as a diſtreſſe, and where to be kept to his owne vſe.</p>
                  <p>If an officer of the Foreſt, or other perſon that ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the Swanimote Court, haue land within the Foreſt, and the beaſtes of a ſtraunger do eſcape into his land, by reaſon whereof the land-tenant doth diſtraine them and put them in the pound in the ſame lande as in one pounde: and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:27422:120"/> the Bedell of the Foreſt doth finde them there ſo leuant and cowchant, afterwards he may diſtraine them for that amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement. But otherwiſe it is if thoſe beaſtes were neuer leuant and cowchant there.</p>
                  <p>If the Bedell of the Foreſt or other officer do break the cloſe or the land that is incloſed with one ditch and a hedge &amp; a gate with a lock to it, and doth there diſtraine for ſuch amercement of the ſame man to whome the land doth belong: That diſtreſſe is not lawfully taken there. But if the gate be vnlocked, or the hedge do lye open, otherwiſe it is. And otherwiſe it is, if ſuch officers do diſtraine ſuch beaſtes in the high way within the Foreſt out of any cloſe or incloſure.</p>
                  <p>And if one be amerced <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> and after that he is ſo amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he doth deliuer his beaſtes and his goods that he hath ſo within the Foreſt to another in pledge or in morgage: There the Bedell of the Foreſt nor other officer cannot afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them during the pledge or morgage.</p>
                  <p>But otherwiſe it is, where iſſues are returned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lands of a freeholder within the Foreſt which hath made default and loſt the iſſues, and afterwardes he doth alien that lande: there the ſaid Bedel may diſtrain in that land that is aliened for thoſe Iſſues that are loſt. And thus much concerning diſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p>It were a thing verie neceſſarie here in this place to ſhewe of what things diſtreſſes may lawfully be made and taken.

                  <p n="1">1 And as concerning the firſt point, which is to preſerue: It is to be vnderſtood,<note place="margin">The office of a Foreſter is to preſerue.</note> that a Foreſter or Keeper of the Foreſt muſt be a ſpeciall preſeruatour of the Vert and Veniſon of the Foreſt, without the which it can be no Foreſt: And therefore ſuch an officer muſt alwayes haue a vigilant eye to preſerue the Couerts of the Foreſt where the wilde beaſtes may haue their
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:27422:121"/> ſecret abyding, and alſo the wilde beaſtes which are beaſtes of venerie. And ſuch an officer may not kil or deſtroy any of thoſe beaſtes of Venerie of his owne authoritie without good War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the ſame: for if he do, the ſame is cauſe of forfeiture of his office. And alſo ſuch an officer muſt be verie carefull to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that the Deare may haue foode in the Winter: And for that cauſe the Law hath prouided that the Foreſter may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lop Trees in another mans land vpon ſome ſpeciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for browſe to ſuccour the Deare in the Foreſt withall, as it hath beene ſhewed before. Like wiſe euery good Foreſter muſt be carefull for the looking vnto his Deare in the fence-moneth, which is the time of their fawning, for the preſeruation of the yong Fawnes, for the encreaſing of the game, according to the Aſſiſes of the Foreſt. And thus much concerning the firſt point of his office, which is to Preſerue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſecond point of the office of a Foreſter is to watch, or to be carefull in attending of the Vert and Veniſon of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to ſee that the ſame be not by any meanes deſtroyed: For as a Foreſter himſelfe may not kill nor deſtroy any of the wilde beaſtes of the Foreſt without good warrant, nor yet cut down or deſtroy the Vert of the Foreſt: No more he muſt not ſuffer any other perſon to do any manner of treſpas in the Foreſt to the hurt of the Vert or Veniſon of the ſame Foreſt. For it doth appeare by the Lawes of <hi>Canutus, Canon.</hi> 2. That Foreſters were appointed at the firſt <hi>Ad ſuſcipiendum Curam &amp; onus tum Viridis tum Veneris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Now the third point of the office of a Foreſter is to attach offenders or treſpaſſers in the Foreſt: So that as a Foreſter by his office is to be a Preſeruatour of the Vert and Veniſon of the Foreſt, and therefore to watch and attend the ſame: He is likewiſe to attach or arreſt all ſuch offenders and treſpaſſers as he ſhall finde offending or treſpaſſing within the Foreſt, to the end that they may receiue ſuch puniſhment for the ſame as the lawes of the Foreſt doth in that behalfe appoint.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Nowe the fourth poynt of the office of a Foreſter is to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:27422:122"/> preſent, which is, that he that is a Foreſter muſt not conceale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of offence that ſhalbe done within the Foreſt by any manner of perſon, either in Vert or Veniſon, but preſent the ſame: and alſo all manner of attachmentes that he hath made for any offence or treſpaſſe of the Foreſt, before the Verderors of the Foreſt, at the fortie daie Courte, and at the Court of the Swanimote, according to the aſſiſes and lawes of the Foreſt, to thend and purpoſe, that the Vert and Veniſon of the Foreſt may be the better preſerued and kept by the due puniſhment of ſuch as ſhalbe founde to be any treſpaſſers or offenders in the ſame: And thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uch concerning the office of a Foreſter.</p>
                  <p>And now becauſe the words are: <hi>Conueniant Foreſtarij vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridarij et agiſtatores:</hi> It is to be ſeene what a Verderor is: how he is made, what is his othe, and alſo what is his office.</p>
                  <p>A Verderor is a iudiciall officer of the Kings Foreſt, choſen by the King in the full Countie of the ſame ſhire within the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt where hee doth dwell,<note place="margin">The definition of a Verderor.</note> and ſworne to maintaine and keepe the aſſiſes of the Foreſt, and alſo to view, receiue and inroll the attachmentes and preſentmentes of all manner of treſpaſſes of the Foreſt of Vert and Veniſon.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be vnderſtood, that there are moſt commonly in euery one of the Kings foreſts within this Realme foure offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the foreſt called Verderors, which ought to be Eſquires or gentlemen of good account, abilitie &amp; liuing, which are wiſe and diſcreete men and well learned in the lawes of the Foreſt. The office of a Verderor is almoſt like vnto the office of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner in ſome poyntes: for as a Coroner by the lawe is to view the dead bodie of any of her Maieſtes Subiects that is ſodainly ſlayne or found dead, and it is not knowen how he doth come by his death, then the Coroner is to repaire to the ſame dead bodie vpon notice thereof vnto him giuen, to ſee and view the ſame, and there alſo to inquire by the othe of xii. good and lawful men vpon the view of the ſame dead bodie, and ſuch eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences &amp; circomſtances as can by any meanes be there learned how he came to his death, and who was the occaſion thereof.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:27422:122"/> Euen ſo a Verderor is to view the wild beaſtes of the Foreſt: And if any of the Kinges wilde beaſtes in the foreſt be found ſlayne or ſore wounded, or hurte: then vpon notice thereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the Verderors or vnto any one of them, then he ought to repaire to the ſame wild beaſt that is ſo ſlayne, killed or hurt, and there to cauſe an inquiſition to be made <hi>per quatuor villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas propinquiores Foreſtae,</hi> to knowe how the ſame wild beaſt was killed, and by whom: as it doth appeare by the aſſiſes of the Foreſt, <hi>Articulo</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Aſſiſa et co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudines Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtae Artic. 7.</note> And ſo a Verderor in that reſpect is an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer like vnto a Coroner. And it is to be noted, that euen as a Coroner is choſen by the Kings write in the full Countie: So is a Verderor alſo, for when any of the Kings Verderors of his Foreſt is dead, then vpon certificat thereof made vnto the King in his highe Courte of Chauncery that <hi>T.

And though that the Hoggs of any other perſon doe remayne all one night
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:27422:125"/> dammage feſant within the Kings Foreſt, yet notwithſtanding he whoſe Hoggs they were ſhall not be impeached or loſe any thing for that offence: But for as much as this letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Carta de Foreſta</hi> was ſo generall a libertie giuen vnto all men, therefore the Aſſiſes and cuſtomes of the Foreſt made in <hi>Anno</hi> 6. <hi>Edwardi.</hi> 1. <hi>Caput</hi> 13. hath made one eſpeciall lymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and order concerning Swine or Hoggs, which is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not beaſts comminable within the Foreſt, nor to be kept there all the whole yeare,<note place="margin">Pag 4</note> but onely during the tyme of Pawnage, yet a man may agiſt his Hoggs yearely within the Foreſt in the tyme of Pawnage, as it doth appeare in the words of the ſame Statut, the words being as followeth: <hi>Si quis habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit boſcum iuxta dominicum boſcum domini Regis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aſſiſa Foreſtae cap 13</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo it doth appeare that the agiſting of the Hoggs of any man at this daie within his owne demeſne Woods within the Foreſt, cannot lawfully be done vntil the demeaſne hedge-rowes and hedges of the King be agiſted, and then he ſhall haue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtment for Hoggs during the tyme of the Pawnage yearely,<note place="margin">What is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtment.</note> by the view of the officers of the Foreſt, and by their diſcreſion aſſigned as the Woods may ſuſtaine. But now here it is verie neceſſarie to ſhew what thing agiſtment is, &amp; what thing Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage is. And for that it is to be vnderſtood, that agiſtment is moſt properly the common of Harbage,<note place="margin">What is Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.</note> of any kind of grounde or land or Woods, or the Mony due for the ſame. And Pawnag is moſt proper the maſt of the Woods or land, or hedg-rowes or the Mony that is due to the owner of the ſame for it.</p>
                  <p>Maiſter <hi>Hesket</hi> in his reading of the Charter of the Foreſt, ſayth that the Pawnage is not the paſture &amp; maſt for the Hoggs within the Foreſt, but ſayth he,<note place="margin">Maſter Hesket fo. 48.</note> it is the dutie or Monie that is to be payed to the owner of the ground, for the paſture feeding and Maſt of Hoggs. And he ſaith further, that the ſame hath beene
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:27422:126"/> ſo adiudged in the tyme of Edward the firſt, but he doth not ſhew in what yeare, but he ſetteth downe the caſe in theſe words.</p>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:27422:127"/> his heire ſhould not be diſinherited. And the verie like caſe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged in <hi>Anno</hi> 19. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and alſo in <hi>M.</hi> 22. of <hi>E.</hi> 3, Where an Eſquire of good accompt which drewe his ſworde to ſtrike ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon in the preſence of the Iuſtices,<note place="margin">19.

And therefore now this graunt and Charter of the Liberties hath prouided a remedie for this extremitie in theſe wordes, <hi>Nullus amittat vitam vel membrum,</hi> which is a verie great libertie vnto all the Kings Subiects. And it is alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and an abridgement of the Kings will and pleaſure, vpon which the puniſhment of ſuch offenders did then onely depende, which at that time was vncertaine, where as nowe the ſame is a moſt certaine puniſhment appointed for thoſe that do hunt the Kings wilde beaſtes: for the words are <hi>Provenatione &amp;c.</hi> So that the ſame Charter is now a generall pardon to all men of life and member for all offences of hunting the Kings wilde beaſtes of Venery.<note place="margin">Pro venatione.</note> And becauſe the letter is <hi>pro Venatione,</hi> it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to conſider what beaſtes are called beaſtes of Venerie or the Kings Veniſon, and therfore it appeareth as it hath been ſhewed before, that there are fiue wilde beaſtes that are accompted beaſts of the Foreſt, that is to ſaie, the <hi>Hart,</hi> the <hi>Hynde,</hi> the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Boare,</hi> and the <hi>Wolfe.</hi> And there are alſo fiue beaſtes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Foreſt that are accompted beaſtes of Chaſe, that is to ſaie,<note place="margin">the v. beaſtes of the Foreſt.

                  <p>The letter is further, <hi>Sed ſi quis captus &amp; conuictus, &amp;c.</hi> Which is as much in effect, as if the wordes had beene, That if the offender be taken and attainted of the Treſpas or offence by the courſe of the Lawes of the Foreſt. But if the defendant vpon an Inditement do confeſſe the offence, or will ſaie nothing at all to it: or will make default after his appearance, if the ſame do paſſe the Swanimote in due forme of Lawe, according to the Statute called <hi>Ordinatio Foreſtae,</hi>

And when any offender is thus conuicted, he ſhall make his fine for the ſame offence: For the letter is further, <hi>Grauiter redimatur,</hi> and that is as much to ſaie, The offender ſo conuicted muſt be grieuouſly redeemed, or make a grieuous Fine or raunſome for his offence.<note place="margin">The diuerſitie betweene a Fyne and a Raunſome.</note> And it is ſaid that there is a great diuerſitie betweene a fine and a raunſome: For a fine is arbitrable by the Iuſtices of the King, and is to be aſſeſſed by them without the King. But a raunſome is not to be aſſeſſed by the Iuſtices of the King onely, but that the King ſhall firſt therein ſhewe his pleaſure and will. And therefore it doth ſeeme that in this caſe the recompence for ſuch an offence is to be called a fine and not a raunſome, becauſe the Iuſtices of the Foreſt do aſſeſſe the ſame without making of the King priuie to it firſt as common experience doth dayly proue, and auncient preſidents of the Lawes of the Foreſt confirme the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And thus hauing paſſed ouer 10. articles of the Charter of the Foreſt, I will here ende &amp; leaue the reſt to others of better lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; iudgement to handle. And becauſe it is verie neceſſarie to ſee and know the manner of the making of a Foreſt, and of the diſſaforeſting of a Foreſt againe: I will now here ſet downe the Charter of the Puraley, to the end that it may thereby appeare in what manner a Foreſt is made: And as a Foreſt is made, in like manner the ſame is made a Puraley &amp; diſſaforeſted againe, as it ſhall appeare by this Preſident hereafter following.</p>
